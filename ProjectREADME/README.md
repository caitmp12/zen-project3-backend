2. App concept: Halloween Pick is an app made to make family (or friend or date!) nights easier to plan and therefor enjoy. The app picks three major picks for your night: your cocktail, your snacks, and your movie. This way you spend less time discussing what everyone wants, and more time enjoying each other's company.    


3. Technologies used
    Express
    Mongoose
    Cors
    Node.js


4. Approach Taken
    This is a full CRUD application, supporting three models to seed data into our MongoDB databases, as well as calls to a third-party movie API. 
    Each model has a corresponding controller, providing the restful routes.
